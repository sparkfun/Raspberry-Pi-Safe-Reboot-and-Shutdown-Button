#
# ==================== DESCRIPTION ====================
#
# This python script takes advantage of the Qwiic pHat v2.0's
# built-in general purpose button to safely reboot/shutdown you Pi:
#
#    1.) If you press the button momentarily, the Pi will reboot.
#    2.) Holding down the button for about 3 seconds the Pi will shutdown.
#
# This example also takes advantage of interrupts so that it uses a negligible
# amount of CPU. This is more efficient since it isn't taking up all of the Pi's
# processing power.
#
# ========== TUTORIAL ==========
#  For more information on running this script on startup,
#  check out the associated tutorial to adjust your "rc.local" file:

#
#        Qwiic pHAT v2.0
#        https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15945
#
#   You can also use any button but you would need to wire it up
#   instead of stacking the pHAT on your Pi.
